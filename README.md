# SystematicReview

This repository contains all the necessary documentation and files related to this systematic review, to ensure transparency, reliability, and replicability of the current systematic review. 

In particular, the repository consists of the following items: 
- a pdf reporting the protocol adopted to conduct the systematic review, including all the research methods adopted; 
- a folder containing the documentation of the entire study selection and quality assessment process, with separate electronic sheets for each selected digital resource (Stages 1 and Stages 2) as well as for Stages 3, 4, and 5. This folder also contains an electronic sheet summarizing the number of research articles excluded for each excluding factor and an electronic sheet detailing the multiple publications of the same IVR-based SGs for autism excluded at stage 5. 
- a folder containing the electronic sheet reporting the data extraction form adopted within this systematic review; 
- a folder containing the full text of all included research articles;
- a folder containing the full text of all reviews analyzed in the Background.


We believe that this repository will prove useful for researchers in the field who are interested in replicating the study, verifying its findings, or simply want to learn from our approach.
